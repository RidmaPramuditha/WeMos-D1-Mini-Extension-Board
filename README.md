# WeMos D1 Mini Extension Board

## ðŸ§© Overview

Innovation-Based Learning (IBL) is a powerful teaching method that helps students learn by doingâ€”solving real-world problems using hands-on experiments. However, in many developing countries, the high cost and fragility of electronics limit students' ability to explore and learn freely.

To address this challenge, a low-cost, beginner-friendly IoT development board was created. This custom platform is designed to minimize hardware damage during learning, reduce cost, and maximize hands-on opportunities.

## Specifications:

- Digital and analog pins are accessible via screw terminals for easy connections.
- Built-in relay for high-voltage switching/control, equipped with NO (Normally Open) and NC (Normally Closed) screw connectors.
- Integrated push buttons for user input.
- RGB LED compatible with the NeoPixel library.
- Two LED indicators (red and green) connected to GPIO pins.
- I2C connector for OLED display compatibility.
- Built-in buzzer for alerts or notifications.
- Plug-and-play WeMos D1 module connector for easy compatibility.
- Effortless installation of WeMos D1 Mini and OLED modules with plugable connectors.

## ðŸ“ˆ Educational Value
- Encourages creativity, experimentation, and problem-solving.
- Reduces fear of hardware damage during trial-and-error learning.
- Helps students understand full-stack IoT conceptsâ€”from sensors to coding to deployment.
- Enables a scalable, inclusive model for hybrid STEM education.

## ðŸ§ª Conclusion
This development board removes key barriers to hands-on STEM education, making Innovation-Based Learning more practical, accessible, and affordable. It empowers studentsâ€”especially in developing regionsâ€”to learn, create, and innovate confidently using real technology.
